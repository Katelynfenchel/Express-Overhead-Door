                <p class="services-description">A complete garage door system is the hardest working and possibly most used system in your house.  Broken garage door springs, cables, rollers, and hinges can and will leave your garage system inoperable and possibly your vehicles stuck!  The garage door system consists of either tension or extension springs, cables, pulleys, drums, end and center bearings, rollers, hinges, tracks, and the door itself.  There are many moving parts to this system!  Replacing springs and cables can be very dangerous, and professional repair is reccomended!  We replace our customers torsion springs with 18-25,000 cycle springs as a standard practice.  Higher cycle springs are avalible on request.  Regular maintenance and safety inspections are reccomended to keep this system working correctly, quietly, efficently, and safely!   We also offer weather seal replacement for both the bottom and around the garage door. </p>
